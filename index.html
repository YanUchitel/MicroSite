            With this well-made stereo turntable, Pioneer proves once again that
            quality and practicality are synonymous. The budget-priced PL-12D
            gives you more for your stereo investment than you'd ever expect. A
            fine synchronous motor that helps cut out audible wow and flutter.
            An extremely steady belt-drive. An anti-skating control to lessen
            distortion. A cueing device with simultaneous movement with the
            start lever. And a beautifully-balanced Sshaped tonearm with plug-in
            type lightweight head-shell. For the man about to make his first
            investment into stereo components, the PL-12D becomes more than a
            budget investment but a truly professional turntable that will serve
            him well for many years of quality sound reproduction.

            <h4>DRIVE MOTOR SECTION</h4>
            The PL-12D employs a 4-pole synchronous motor and a beltdrive system
            to ensure stable rotation of the turntable platter that is free from
            line voltage fluctuation. The synchronous motor is much like the
            motors usually used only in expensive turntables, and is the
            quietest that you can own. lt gives you an extremely high
            signal-to-noise ratio, extremely low wow and flutter, and helps cut
            down on irritating motor vibration<br />

              alt="image of the drive motor section"
            /><br />
            <h4>TONEARM SECTION</h4>
            The tonearm of the PL-12D is the static-balanced, S-shaped type that
            uses a super hard alloy material at the pivot point of its arm,
            thereby assuring sensitive, stable tracking at all

            times. The counter weight of the tone arm is the styrus pressure
            direct-reading type that gives easy weight adjustment when
            cartridge-changing is necessary. Then there is a lightweight plug-in
            type head-shell so that you may use a cartridge with its stylus
            pressure from 0.75 grams. To cut down on distortion, the PL-12D has
            an anti-skating control to suppress the harmful inward force of the
            stylus.<br />

            /><br />
            <h4>OTHER DISTINCTIVE FEATURES</h4>
            The cueing control, an oil-damped arm elevation device, is connected
            to the start lever and helps prevent damage to your stylus or your
            record usually caused by misoperation. There is a stylus position
            gauge to faciritate easy installation of your favorite cartridge.
            And pioneer used aluminum foil on the inner part of the PL-12D's
            wooden cabinet to prevent external noise often caused by your
            amplifier or other equipment placed near the turntable. The cabinet
            itself, eleganily styled, is the spring-suspension type and designed
            to cope with external vibration. The dust cover of the pL-12D is
            hinged in the free-stop manner, permitting you to leave it at rest
            at any angle you choose.
