            Pioneer’s legacy began in 1930, when the founder Nozomu Matsumoto
            had a life-changing experience of listening to music reproduced from
            imported hi-fi dynamic speakers. He was so impressed with the
            soul-stirring sound that he decided to make great-sounding dynamic
            speakers for others to enjoy. Matsumoto’s passion and belief in
            sharing a thrilling sensation with others runs in the Pioneer
            Group’s philosophy “Move the Heart and Touch the Soul,” which has
            guided us in decision-making in business for decades.
